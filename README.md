# customized-crm

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## Environment Variables

Authentication and storage are powered by Supabase. Before running the project you must provide your Supabase URL and anon key.

1. Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local`.
2. Fill in `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` with the values from your Supabase project.
3. Restart the development server.

Without these variables the app will fail to start and throw a "Missing SUPABASE_URL environment variable" error.

## Running the Business Hub Desktop App

An Electron environment is provided for running the Business Hub locally. Install dependencies and start the app with:

```bash
npm run electron-dev
```

This command launches the Next.js dev server and opens the Electron window. A basic SQLite database backs a small Express API at `http://localhost:4000`.
Build installers with:

```bash
npm run electron-pack
```

For a production build, export the Next.js app and then package Electron:

```bash
npm run build-electron
```

The Accounting solution page includes a **Download** button that points to
`public/business-hub-installer.exe`. Replace this placeholder file with the
installer generated by `npm run build-electron` so visitors can download the
Business Hub desktop app.
