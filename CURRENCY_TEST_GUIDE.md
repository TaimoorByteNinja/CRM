/**
 * Test Documentation: Currency Integration with Country Selection
 * 
 * This file documents how to test the currency integration between
 * CountrySelectionOverlay, BusinessManager, and Overview pages.
 */

## Test Steps:

### 1. Reset Setup State (For Testing)
- Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/business-hub?reset-setup=true`
- This will trigger the country selection overlay again

### 2. Select Different Countries
- Choose different countries in the overlay (e.g., India, United States, United Kingdom)
- Click "Continue with [Country]"
- Verify the overlay closes

### 3. Check Currency Updates in Overview Page
- Navigate to the Overview/Dashboard section
- Check that all financial metrics display with the correct currency:
  - India: â‚¹ (Indian Rupee)
  - United States: $ (US Dollar)  
  - United Kingdom: Â£ (British Pound)
- Verify charts, totals, and financial data use consistent currency formatting

### 4. Check Currency Updates in Business Manager
- Navigate to the Business Manager section
- Check that the currency symbols and formatting match the selected country
- Verify cart totals use the correct currency
- Ensure module prices display with proper currency symbols

### 6. Check Currency Updates in Parties Page
- Navigate to the Parties section
- Check that all financial data displays with the correct currency:
  - Balance amounts in party listings
  - Credit limits in party details
  - Transaction amounts in history
- **Form Fields** - Verify currency symbols appear in:
  - "Opening Balance" field (shows currency symbol)
  - "Credit Limit" field (shows currency symbol)
  - "Transaction Amount" field (shows currency symbol)

### 7. Verify Cross-Page Consistency
- Switch between Overview, Business Manager, and Parties pages
- Ensure all pages show the same currency formatting
- Check that all price displays are consistent across the application

## Expected Behavior:

### Before Fix:
- Country selection didn't update currency in Business Manager or Overview
- Currency remained as default (USD) regardless of country selection
- Different pages might show different currency formats

### After Fix:
- Currency automatically updates based on selected country from Redux store
- Both Overview and Business Manager use `useCurrency` hook connected to Redux
- All currency formatting is consistent across all pages
- Real-time updates when country changes

## Technical Implementation:

### Updated Files:
1. `lib/currency-manager.ts` - Connected to Redux store
2. `app/business-hub/business-manager/page.tsx` - Uses Redux-based currency
3. `app/business-hub/overview/page.tsx` - Enhanced with Redux integration  
4. `app/business-hub/parties/page.tsx` - Integrated currency and enhanced forms
5. `components/CountrySelectionOverlay.tsx` - Updates Redux settings

### Key Changes:
- CurrencyManager now reads from Redux store via `useAppSelector`
- Overview page imports general settings and reacts to country changes
- Business Manager removed local currency state
- Parties page replaced hardcoded INR formatting with Redux-connected currency
- Enhanced form fields with currency symbols and proper labeling
- Currency changes are managed centrally through Redux
- Added useEffect to trigger re-renders when country changes

## Pages with Currency Integration:

### âœ… Fully Integrated:
- **Overview Page**: All financial metrics, charts, totals
- **Business Manager**: Product prices, cart totals, calculations
- **Parties Page**: Balance amounts, credit limits, transaction forms with currency symbols
- **Sales Page**: Invoice customization and currency display
- **Purchase Page**: Purchase amounts and totals
- **Reports Page**: All financial reports and summaries

### ðŸ”„ Auto-Updates on Country Change:
- Dashboard metrics and KPIs
- Revenue and profit calculations
- Inventory values
- Transaction histories
- Target tracking

## Notes:
- Currency conversion functionality was disabled (complex feature)
- Users can change currency by changing country in settings or overlay
- All existing prices remain in their original values (no automatic conversion)
- Real-time updates ensure immediate currency display changes
