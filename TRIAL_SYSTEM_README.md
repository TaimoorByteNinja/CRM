## 🔐 Security Features

### Cryptographic Protection
- **HMAC-SHA256**: Secure hash generation for data integrity
- **AES Encryption**: Trial and subscription data encrypted in storage
- **Tamper Detection**: Automatic detection of data manipulation attempts
- **Fallback Handling**: Graceful degradation when security checks fail

### Storage Strategy
- **Primary**: Encrypted localStorage with hash verification
- **Backup**: SQLite database for Electron app persistence
- **Session**: Temporary session storage for UI state

## 🔄 Trial Flow

### 1. Download & Initialization
```typescript
// User downloads from /solutions/accounting
const trialInfo = TrialManager.initializeTrial()
// Creates encrypted trial data with 7-day expiry
```

### 2. App Usage Tracking
```typescript
// Business hub layout checks trial status
const { trialInfo, showTrialModal } = useTrialManagement()
// Displays status banner and blocks access when expired
```

### 3. Upgrade Flow
```typescript
// User clicks upgrade → goes to /pricing
const subscription = activatePremium('premium')
// Creates 1-year subscription with encrypted storage
```

## 🎯 Key Components

### TrialManager Class
Core business logic for trial and subscription management:

```typescript
// Initialize new trial
const trial = TrialManager.initializeTrial()

// Check current status  
const status = TrialManager.getAccessStatus()

// Activate premium
const sub = TrialManager.activatePremiumSubscription('premium')
```

### useTrialManagement Hook
React integration for trial state:

```typescript
const {
  trialInfo,           // Current trial status
  subscriptionInfo,    // Current subscription
  showTrialModal,      // Show expiry modal
  activatePremium,     // Upgrade function
  getAccessStatus      // Access check
} = useTrialManagement()
```

### TrialExpiryModal Component
User interface for trial management:

```typescript
<TrialExpiryModal 
  isOpen={showTrialModal}
  onClose={closeTrialModal}
  trialInfo={trialInfo}
/>

<TrialStatusBanner
  trialInfo={trialInfo}
  subscriptionInfo={subscriptionInfo}
  onUpgradeClick={handleUpgrade}
/>
```

## 📊 Database Schema

### Electron SQLite Tables
```sql
-- Trial tracking
CREATE TABLE trial_data (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  start_date TEXT NOT NULL,
  end_date TEXT NOT NULL,  
  hash TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TEXT DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Subscription tracking
CREATE TABLE subscription_data (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  plan_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  start_date TEXT NOT NULL,
  end_date TEXT NOT NULL,
  is_active INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
  hash TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TEXT DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### API Endpoints
```bash
# Trial management
GET  /api/trial           # Get trial status
POST /api/trial           # Create trial

# Subscription management  
GET  /api/subscription    # Get active subscription
POST /api/subscription    # Create subscription
```

## 🎨 UI Components

### Trial Status Indicators
- **Green**: Premium subscription active
- **Blue**: Trial active with days remaining  
- **Orange**: Trial expiring soon (≤2 days)
- **Red**: Trial expired - upgrade required

### Progress Tracking
- Visual progress bars for trial and subscription
- Real-time day counting and remaining time
- Percentage completion indicators

### Upgrade Prompts

## 🔧 Configuration

### Trial Settings
```typescript
private static readonly TRIAL_DAYS = 7;
private static readonly SECRET_KEY = 'craft-crm-trial-key-2025-secure';
```

### Subscription Duration
```typescript
// 1 year subscription
const endDate = new Date(Date.now() + 365 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)
```

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Check Access Permission
```typescript
const hasAccess = TrialManager.hasPremiumAccess()
if (!hasAccess) {
  // Block feature or show upgrade prompt
}
```

### Initialize Trial on Download
```typescript
const handleDownload = () => {
  const trialInfo = TrialManager.initializeTrial()
  console.log(`Trial expires: ${trialInfo.endDate}`)
  // Proceed with app download
}
```

### Handle Subscription Upgrade
```typescript
const handleUpgrade = async (planType: string) => {
  const subscription = activatePremium(planType)
  router.push('/business-hub') // Redirect to app
}
```

## 🔍 Testing & Development

### Development Helpers
The system includes several development helpers for testing:

```javascript
// Reset all trial data
window.clearAllPINData()

// Check trial status
console.log(TrialManager.getAccessStatus())

// Force show trial modal
showTrialModalNow()
```

### Testing Scenarios
1. **New User**: Download → 7-day trial starts → App access granted
2. **Trial Expiry**: Day 7 → Modal appears → Upgrade required
3. **Premium Upgrade**: Purchase → 1-year access → Full features
4. **Tamper Protection**: Modify localStorage → Security warning → Fallback
